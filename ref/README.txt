We'd like to note that the submission you see here is not necessarily the same as what you would see in the demo video.  This is because we had to make a couple of bug fixes, and also we did not show the Levenshtein window, which you can get to by a menu.

Please send us an email at nro5@pitt.edu and joj33@pitt.edu if you have any questions.
